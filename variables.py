# var is like box in ur computer where u store values
# the box has name like age, name, spam, eggs
# the box holds one value at a time like 24, "Hello", 3.14

# think of like this :

spam = 24

# it means u name a box name spam and put 24 inside it


# example:

big = 40
egg = 2
print(big + egg)

# op
# 42

# here python remembers the value inside the boxes and does math

# var can change (overwrite)

# if you do

spam = 10
spam = 20

# now the spam holds 20 not 10
# the old value is forgotten

# basic rules for var names

# can use num, letters and underscores
# can not start with a number
# can not use spaces
# can not use python keywords like if, for, while etc

# examples:

# good
age = 24
myName = "Bhushan"
total_count = 100
num1 = 16

# bad
# my name = "Bhushan"
# 1num = 16
# total$ = 100

# var are case-sensitive
spam = 100
Spam = 100
SPAM = 100
# are all diff

# using a var with math

x = 1
y = 2
print(x + y)

# op
# 3

# using a var with text

name = "Bhushan"
print("Hello " + name)

# op
# Hello Bhushan

# quick exercises

# 1.Create a variable and print it

city = "Pune"
print(city)

# op
# Pune

# 2.Change a variable value

name = "Bhushan"
name = "Arjun"
print(name)

# op
# Arjun

# 3.Combine variables

a = 10
b = 20
print(b / a)

# op
# 2.0
